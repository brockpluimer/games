**BLOCKER README**

**Overview**

Blocker is a dynamic and engaging game implemented using Pygame, where players navigate a customizable block across a dangerous road filled with moving cars to reach safety on the other side (like frogger, but with a Block). The game becomes increasingly challenging as you progress, with cars speeding up and spawning more frequently. Players can personalize their experience by choosing the block color and selecting between Dark Mode and Light Mode for gameplay.

**How to Run the Script**

To start the game, run the command python3 blocker.py in your terminal. At launch, you will be prompted to personalize your gameplay experience by selecting the color for your block and choosing the theme mode. Use the arrow keys to navigate the block across the screen, aiming to avoid collisions with cars.
