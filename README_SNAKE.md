SNAKE README

Overview
This Python script brings the classic Snake game to life, featuring customizable color schemes for the snake, food, and background, as well as dynamic score tracking and a local leaderboard system. The game is built using Pygame for graphical rendering and event handling, offering a simple yet engaging gameplay experience.

How to Run the Script
Launch the game by entering python3 snake_game.py in your terminal. Upon starting, you'll be prompted to customize your game experience by choosing colors for different game elements and configuring gameplay options such as score visibility and wall behavior. Navigate the snake using the arrow keys to eat food and grow in length. The game ends when the snake hits the wall (if wrap-around is disabled) or itself.
